### Stack
A stack is a linear list of elements in which insertions and deletions can take place only at one
end, called the top. Stacks are also called last-in first-out (LIFO) system.

Stack Operations:
These are two basic operations in stack:
=> Push() is the term used to insert an element into a stack.
=> Pop() is the term used to delete an element from a stack.

=> Algorithm for PUSH:
PUSH(STACK[], TOP, MAXSTK, ITEM)
This procedure pushes an ITEM into a stack

1. [STACK already filled?]
If TOP=MAXSTK, then: Print: OVERFLOW / Stack Full, and Return.

2. Set TOP = TOP+1. [Increase TOP by 1.]
3. Set STACK[TOP] = ITEM. [Insert ITEM in new TOP position.]
4. Return.

=> Algorithm for Pop: 
POP(STACK, TOP, ITEM)
This procedure deletes the top element of STACK and assigns it to the variable ITEM.

1. [STACK has an item to be removed? Check for empty stack]
If TOP=0, then: Print: UNDERFLOW/ Stack is empty, and Return.
2. Set ITEM=STACK[TOP]. [Assign TOP element to ITEM.]
3. Set TOP=TOP-1. [Decrease TOP by 1.]
4. Return.

=> Applications of Stack:
1. To reverse a word (string): Stack is used for reversing a string. Put all the letters in a stack and pop them out.
2. Expression conversion: Stack can also be used for expression conversion. This is one of the most important applications of stack.
3. DFS (Depth First Search): This search is implemented on a Graph, and Graph uses the stack data structure.
4. In Browsers: The back button in a browser saves all the URLs you have visited previously in a stack.

=> Arithmetic Expression:
From the google slide.
=> Infix Notation: When the operator symbol is placed between its two operands in the arithmetic operations then it is called infix notation.

=> Postfix Notation: When the operator symbol is placed after its two operands in the arithmetic operations then it is called postfix notation.
